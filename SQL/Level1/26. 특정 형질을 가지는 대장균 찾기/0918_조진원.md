### 1차시도
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS COUNT
FROM
(SELECT SUBSTRING(C, 1, 1) AS COL1,
SUBSTRING(C, 2, 1) AS COL2,
SUBSTRING(C, 3, 1) AS COL3,
SUBSTRING(C, 4, 1) AS COL4
FROM (
SELECT LPAD(CONV(GENOTYPE,10,2),4,'0') AS C
FROM ECOLI_DATA) AS SUB1) AS SUB2
WHERE SUB2.COL2 != 0 AND (SUB2.COL1 = 1 OR SUB2.COL3=1);
```

### 비트연산자 활용
컴퓨터는 2진수로 값을 변환해서 인지하기때문에 &를 쓰면 된다

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS COUNT
FROM ECOLI_DATA
WHERE (GENOTYPE & 2 = 0) AND (GENOTYPE & 1 != 0 OR GENOTYPE & 4 != 0);
```
